# Synopsis
The authors pioneer a deep learning (DL) approach to reconstruct sea surface height (SSH) using altimetry and sea surface temperature (SST) observations. Although SSH is constructed by way of optimal interpolation (OI), the authors find that DL is superior in reconstructing quantities like eddy kinetic energy, vorticity, and strain rate.

## Key Points
- DL models are universal function approximators. Given sufficient dynamical information encoded in the training data, and a sufficiently expressive model, a DL model can learn dynamical relationships at any level of complexity.
